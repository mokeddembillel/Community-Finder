# Community-Finder
- I created this algorithm in 2017 when i started programming to solve the community detecion problem, 
it's a pretty complicated algorithm that works on multiple steps which most of them are recursive functions
- I made the UI using WinForms and got some of the components form the Bunifu library, so if you want to modify the UI you need a Bunifu Licence, 
but it's okay you can get a 30 days free trial
- for the graph visualization you have to install graphViz and add it to environment variables

- Good Luck ^^
